The team is learning more and more about importance of how important is effective communication for the betterment of the team. I have observed the more the team has meeting and more team talks face to face about the project the more better it gets. In this week the team had two meetings and there was a very healthy discussion on what could be the different issues and what can be its effects. Also the team is providing feedback in a way that could make the game better. The best part is everyone is giving ideas when the team is struck. So there is an effort from everyone in the team to make the game better.
