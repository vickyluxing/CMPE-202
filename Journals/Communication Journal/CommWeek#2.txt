Week#2 : Last week the topics of the CS unplugged were divided among the team members. Each member has to go through the topic and select which they feel we can conduct among the children and also make a game. The team had a meeting where all the team members pitched their ideas to the team. Here we saw the importance of "Communication" , while people were explaining their idea sometimes other members of the team were not able to understand the activity which means the speaker was not able to Communicate the idea properly. But when communicated properly by giving examples the team members were able to grasp the concept. It was very important for each member to grasp the idea , as without it a person might not be able to make a proper decision, which of the activities is best for the team. After the activities were discussed each of the team member also gave back their ideas on which can be the best project.Also we could see a change in team , like everyone was trying to speak in English as much as possible , until and unless they were not able to express something , they express that in a language understood by a partner who would express it English so everyone would understand.So finally the team picked "Searching Algorithams" as the team's choice for the project.
