Week#3 : This week the team finalized on the project in the initial days of the week. Later the initial design that the team had selected had some design gaps in it. The team members communicated the problem the problems via email and the team came up with  a solution on how we can implement a slightly different design and one of the team members documented the steps in detail and sent it to the team members on how we can make a different design to overcome the challenge we were facing initially.
