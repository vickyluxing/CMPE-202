In this week the team worked towards making more progress to the game. Also the team was making it more user friendly by adding different sounds for the user. The team also had a couple of meetings where everyone was sharing there opinions on how can we have the game in a good way so that it can be a nice multiplayer game. Everyone gave in their ideas on how can we implement different multiplayers types for the game.And the team as usual had 2-3 sessions where all the members of the team sat together and brainstormed for completing the project. As the weeks progress there is also a good vibe among the team as well as the team is working hard to complete the game on time.
