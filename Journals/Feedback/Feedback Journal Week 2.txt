Feedback Week#2:
Team members individually assessed the CSUnplugged activities and made an outline of them. All of us gave a small presentation of the activities we liked. Then we discussed  over the strong points and weak points of the activities, and gave our feedback on them. Bases on the feedback, we narrowed down the options of the activities and then chose the activity “Searching Algorithms” for the project. We were looking for a topic on which we can have a good classroom physical activity, as well as on which a good visual game can be demonstrated. Team's feedback led us to choose the topic.
Next activity was to decide over which tool to use to build the game. With the choices of Greenfoot and Processing in hand, through the mutual feedback we selected Greenfoot, considering it offers a good mix of both Visual and programmable components. I volunteered for the role of the UI/UX design and will be presenting the UI to the team to be able to get their feedback.
