Feedback:
Feedback has a crucial value in a project and inside a team. Iterative feedback from stakeholders and fellow developers on team helps project to proceed in the right direction efficiently. Feedback among the development team generally involves all heads of the team think about the solution of the problem for a while and give their honest opinion about the solution. This way team can judge the work before forwarding the work further to other stakeholders. For instance, in our team we were working on choosing the name of the team and had a chance of exploring the horizon with the feedback of the team. Similarly, team gave their feedback in design of the team logo. As we proceed, whenever a plan of action is proposed now; for instance, to find a project or to prepare a document; everyone in the team is giving their feedback on how the original proposal can be enhanced by adding or changing which aspect. Like, team members were searching the activities at csunplugged (http://csunplugged.org/activities/) individually, but after a constructive feedback we were able to divide the work by assigning a set of activities to individuals. Over a week’s effort together, feedback played a vital role in Team building and in organization of work.
