In a project especially a team project,communication plays a vital role irrespective of a person’s role in the project.Every team member must be very open & honest when communicating with the team, as being dishonest can sometimes cause huge problems in a team.With good communication each of the team member is clear with what is task assigned and what is his/her role in the team.Research also shows that team that communicate well are more efficient in completing projects and are also more accurate.
Week#1 :Our team being an Indo-Chinese, communication plays a big part as being from different countries and different cultures there might be miscommunication within the team and this may affect the outcome of the task. So as to improve the communication between the team, the team has decided to speak only in “English” when the team is together. Speaking in a language which is not understood by even one person of the team may offend the person. Also team is using the social media app, Whatsapp to communicate within the team to check everyone’s availability and schedule project discussions and team meeting so that no one is missed out.
