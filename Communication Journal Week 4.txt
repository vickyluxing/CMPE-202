Communication:
In this week team had a good brainstorming session on what could be different approaches in which we can implement the game and what could be better designs among the different choices. The team also discussed on how UI could be improved and be more user friendly, or what could be done better.
We also discussed on the various diagrams that would need to be completed, and what would be required in our project.This week i could see better communication between the team is improving.
